{"What are neurons": "Neurons are specialized cells in the brain and nervous system. They communicate using electrical impulses and neurotransmitters. Each neuron connects to others via synapses.", "Neuroplasticity": "Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to rewire itself. When you learn something new, synapses strengthen or weaken. This adaptability is strongest in childhood.", "Short-Term and Long-term memory": "Memory is categorized into short-term and long-term forms. Neurons involved in memory storage fire in specific patterns. Dopamine can reinforce memory encoding.", "Dopomine and reward": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation and pleasure. It's often released when we experience something rewarding. This process is key in habit formation.", "Synapses in Learning": "Learning involves repeated activation of synapses. As synaptic strength increases, so does the efficiency of signal transmission between neurons. This is the basis for learning and memory."}
